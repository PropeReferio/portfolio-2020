				<h3>STRONG COMMUNICATOR</h3>
				<p className="about">I'm a developer with many interests, which has 
					exposed me to many
					walks of life. As a result of this, and having worked in skiing and
					skydiving instruction, I'm able to talk to just about anyone and convey
					my ideas clearly.
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					This translates into the way I code. I'm careful to leave lots of 
					comments, and give my functions/classes descriptive names that obviates
					the need for guesswork by my coworkers.
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					I'm also fluent in Spanish.
				</p>
				<h3>PROBLEM SOLVER</h3>
				<p className='about'>
					I'm committed to doing things the right way the first time. I love
					working on difficult problems and the thrill of finding the solution.
				</p>
				<h3>SELF-MANAGED</h3>
				<p className="about">I manage myself 
					and my time well, and stay on task while working remotely.
				</p>
