					I think about Bo! I was his manager and mentor while he worked in 
					our fast-paced start-up.  Although he came from a Python background 
					he jumped right into building an app--learning Javascript and 
					React Native along the way. He took time to prepare for our 
					meetings to keep them efficient, and best of all pleasant. 
					Bo is a great person to work with and I look forward to our 
					continued relationship.'

					I brought Bo on for a data visualization project, which he 
					quickly brought to fruition with minimal guidance. He 
					selected the technologies and architecture for the project,
					 learning new methodologies as necessary. I can personally 
					 tell how passionate he is about this job, by how quickly 
					 he learns new tools, and how excited he is to implement 
					 them. He is also a great communicator and explains his 
					 work very clearly. Bo would be an asset to any company.'
