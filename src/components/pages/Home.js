                <p>Highly adaptable and ready to learn. Thatâ€™s what comes to mind when 
                I think about Bo! I was his manager and mentor while he worked in 
                our fast-paced start-up.  Although he came from a Python background 
                he jumped right into building an app--learning Javascript and 
                React Native along the way. He took time to prepare for our 
                meetings to keep them efficient, and best of all pleasant. 
                Bo is a great person to work with and I look forward to our 
                continued relationship.</p>

                <p>Working with a self-starter like Bo has been so refreshing.
                   I brought Bo on for a data visualization project, which he 
                   quickly brought to fruition with minimal guidance. He 
                   selected the technologies and architecture for the project,
                    learning new methodologies as necessary. I can personally 
                    tell how passionate he is about this job, by how quickly 
                    he learns new tools, and how excited he is to implement 
                    them. He is also a great communicator and explains his 
                    work very clearly. Bo would be an asset to any company.</p>
